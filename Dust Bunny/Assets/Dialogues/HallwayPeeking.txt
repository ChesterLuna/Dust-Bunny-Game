:There it is... Sleeping, I'll bet. Now, what do I do...

!(Spek paces back and forth.)

#Spek
:I need to stop it from eating, but how?

!Spek stops

#Spek
:Now that I think about it...

#Spek
:I could've sworn it got louder after eating all that dust earlier.

#Spek
:Almost like it took more work.

#Spek
:Is dust really the answer here?

#Spek
:I guess it's worth a try, but this place looks so clean already.

#Spek
:Where could I even find any?
