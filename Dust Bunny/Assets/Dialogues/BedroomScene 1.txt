:Spek steps out of the dim of the Underbed and into the Outside.

# 
:They slow to a stop and look out upon the vast world before them.

#Spek
:...

#Spek
:Wow. I don't know what I was expecting, but this…

#Spek
:I always thought the Underbed was big already.

#Spek
:And it is, compared to the Burrow, but to think that something even bigger existed beyond, ha!

#Spek
:I knew it was wise to send Pip back. I don't know if I could really protect them out here.

# 
:Spek paces back and forth, talking to no one in particular.

#Spek
:Well, I can't help but feel a little intimidated now.

#Spek
:Maybe I've chomped off more than I can chew with this. Should I head back, too?

#Spek
:No, but the others are counting on me to put a stop to this, I can't squeak out now…

# 
:Spek turns to look out across the Outside once more.

#Spek
:(Long sigh) Okay. It's just a bigger room.

#Spek
:It might be bigger, but that doesn't mean I can't get through it the same as the Underbed.

#Spek
:There's no point stopping now, especially after I sent Pip back…

#Spek
:Let's go, then. One hop at a time.
