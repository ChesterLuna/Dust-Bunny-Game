:Where are you going?

#Pip
:To find the source!

#Spek
:…Of what exactly?

#Pip
:Dunno! There was a noise and then everything was shaking and no one could settle down and a tunnel collapsed and- 

#Spek
:Woah woah, slow down little bun.

#Pip
:The Burrow is all sorts of out of sorts. And I just know something on the Outside is the cause.

#Pip 
:So I’m going to find out what it is!

#Spek
:Oh no you don’t. 

#Spek
:You can’t just hop on out there! That’s nobun’s land!

#Pip
:But we can’t do nothing. Our home is in danger!

#Spek
:You’re still no more than a mote. It’s too dangerous for you. 

#Spek
:*Huff* I’ll go. You stay here with Hodge. 

#Pip
:But- but-

#Spek
:Don’t fret Pip, I’ll be back in a jiffy.
