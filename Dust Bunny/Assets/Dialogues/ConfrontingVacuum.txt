!(Spek walks right up to the mouth of the vacuum.)

#Spek
:Alright, here goes!

!(Spek jumps up, and upon landing creates a pile of dust in front of the vacuumâ€”the size of which scales with their dust level. They step out from behind it and start pushing/headbutting it.)

!(Fade out)

!(When the screen fades back in, the dust is gone.)

#Spek
:Phew, that was a lot of work. I hope it was enough...

#Spek
:I gotta get out of here before it wakes up.

#Spek
:Maybe there's somewhere safe that I can watch with Pip?
