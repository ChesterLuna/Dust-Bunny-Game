#Pip
:Spek! I scouted ahead a little past the door. I think I found something interesting!

#Spek
:What is it?

#Pip
:Well, you see… There was this great, black rope.

#Pip
:When the earthshaker came to life earlier, I noticed that it had a rope attached to its back.

#Pip
:And there's another rope here behind the door!

#Pip
:It was attached to the wall, and I think if I'm right about this...

#Pip
:The earthshaker will eventually have to come back to that spot!

#Pip
:We'll be able to find it if we just wait nearby!

#Spek
:(Huff) I see… You did great, Pip. That's great news.

#Spek
:Now all we need to worry about is how exactly to stop it.

#Pip
:How do we stop it?

#Spek
:I don't know, but I think I have an idea.
