:Wow. I don't know what I was expecting, but this…

#Spek
:It's so big.

:*Shiver* I'm glad I sent Pip back. It'd be too dangerous for them here, especially with the rumblers roaming about.

#Spek
:Maybe I've chomped off more than I can chew with this. Should I head back, too?

#Spek
:No, the others are counting on me to put a stop to the great rumbling… 

#Spek
:I can't squeak out now!
