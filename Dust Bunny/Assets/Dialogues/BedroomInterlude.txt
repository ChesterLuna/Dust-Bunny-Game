#Spek
:Who's there!?

# 
:Rattle… Rattle… Clank!

:(A familiar face falls out of the vent.)

#Spek
:Pip!? What are you doing here? It's dangerous!

#Pip
:O-Oh! Hi, Spek! I was just leaving, don't worry about me-

#Spek
:Pipsqueak!

#Pip
:…

#Spek
:I told you it was dangerous! We don't know when the great rumbling will show up again, so you can't be all the way out here!

#Pip
:Sorry… I just wanted to help.

#Spek
:*Sigh* …

#Spek
:Alright, but just tell me first. How'd you even get out here?

#Pip
:I can fit into the gaps here 'cause I'm so small.

#Pip
:They were a bit confusing to explore but you know I'm good at that so eventually I found a way to the Outside.

#Pip
:I promise they're safe! Nothing else can get into them anyways. 

#Pip
:If you really want me to go back I can, but…

#Pip
:I just want to help.

#Spek
:Okay, okay. But you need to stay hidden, alright? Don't come out without checking first.

#Pip
:You got it!

:(Pip jumps up and down a few times, then disappears back into the wall.)
