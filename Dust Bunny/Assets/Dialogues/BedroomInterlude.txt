:Rattle… Rattle… Clank!

#Spek
:Pip!? 

#Spek
:What are you doing here? It's dangerous!

#Pip
:O-Oh! Hi, Spek! I was just leaving, don't worry about me-

#Spek
:Pipsqueak!

#Pip
:…

#Spek
:We don't know when the earthshaker will show up again, so you can't be way out here!

#Pip
:Sorry… I just wanted to help.

#Spek
:*Sigh*

#Spek
:How'd you even get here?

#Pip
:I can fit into the gaps 'cause I'm so small.

#Pip
:They were a bit confusing to navigate but, you know, I'm good at exploring, so eventually I found my way to the Outside.

#Pip
:I promise it's safe! Nothing else can get in there anyways. 

#Pip
:If you really want me to go back I can, but…

#Pip
:I just want to help.

#Spek
:Okay, okay. But you need to stay hidden, alright? Don't come out without checking first.

#Pip
:You got it!
